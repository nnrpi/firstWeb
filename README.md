There is a site that allows you to join the New Year party and write what food you'll bring.

## Usage
It's very simple in using: just write your name and surname, and you'll be redirected to the webpage with food. Here you can write in the form the food that you'd like to bring and press the button, and your food will appears in the table. If you'd like to leave the party, just press the button.
